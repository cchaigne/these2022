----EXPLANATION-------------------------------------
you can use this script to align files generated by the Noldus

----STEPS-------------------------------------------
1. empty the 'not_aligned' folder
2. put the files to align in the 'not_aligned' folder
3. run the script 'align_files.R'(either run each line with Ctrl+Enter or Ctrl+Alt+R to run all the lines) : BEWARE YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS IN POPPING WINDOWS
4. your aligned file is in the 'aligned' folder

----TO CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES----------------
1. be sure you have the correct libraries installed in R studio : readxl, writexl, dplyr, tcltk, svDialogs (if they are not installed, an error message "aucun package nommé 'nomdelalibrairie' n'est trouvé" should appear). To install the library run this command :
install.packages("nomdelalibrairie")
2. be sure the set directory is appropriate (it points to the folder which contains your file)
